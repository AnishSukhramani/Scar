# Scar
Scar is a Python-based voice recognition system that can carry out voice-based commands. 
Scar itself interacts with users with its very own voice and has a bunch of pre-uploaded comebacks. 
He can perform basic tasks like telling time, playing music, etc., and more complex tasks such as sending emails and playing the famous game of 21 dares. 
From the pre-uploaded comebacks, I have tried to give Scar his own unique personality, but I would love as many suggestions as I can get.
